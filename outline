-	I would like my opening screen to consist of photos of plates of food. When any part of the screen is clicked, the screen 
scrolls up to reveal the start of the writing.

-	Pretty early on in the piece I want to have a pie chart to depict the make up of ethnic restaurants in New York City. I want to
make it so that hovering over each piece of the pie chart makes a box pop up (like the one in the Oscars interactive) that 
provides basic information i.e. Middle Eastern, 57 restaurants in NYC. 15 Brooklyn, 3 Staten Island, 30 Manhattan, 2 Bronx, 
7 Queens.

-	I want to create some additional data graphs that depict the make up of the grades of these restaurants. Clicking or hovering 
over a graph will make a space open up / pull the content below it down. In the newly created space additional information about 
the specific type of ethnic restaurant will appear. I.e. if the average number of restaurants getting As sinks dramatically in 
ethnic neighborhoods this will be shown.
